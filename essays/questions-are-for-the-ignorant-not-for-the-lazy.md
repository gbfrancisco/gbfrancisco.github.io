## A powerful tool for mankind

When attempting to understand new concepts that seem too complex to grasp or trying to master a certain skill but cannot seem to progress, it never hurts to ask for assistanceâ€”one beautiful aspect of the human language that has enabled humankind to prosper and improve our quality of life. **That is our ability to ask questions**. Each question has the potential to inspire new ideas and unlock breakthroughs that otherwise could not have been discovered; it could stimulate people's imagination and creativity, and it encourages others to learn about the subject matter. However, despite the benefits it offers, a question could also demotivate others, depending on its delivery and depth. For instance, a computer scientist will inevitably get stuck on certain problems, multiple times in his career. Sometimes, it is necessary to ask others some meaningful questions.

## How do you ask questions?

Eric S. Raymond, one of the authors of "How to Ask Questions The Smart Way", provides several key points on how to ask smart and meaningful questions. He descriptively laid out how "hackers" love solving challenging problems and that it keeps their minds constantly engaged and stimulated. That is not to say they are always available around, answering every question they find, continuously catering to people's ignorance. They have lives too, they have their own problems to deal with and throwing lackadaisical questions at them will not help them at all. In Raymond's essay, there are select key points that stand out the most among his ample set of rules: 

- Know at least somthing about what you're asking
- Use meaningful, specific subject headers
- Be precise and informative about your problem

According to Raymond,

> When you ask your question, display \[...\] that you're not being a lazy sponge and wasting people's time.

My personal interpretation on this key point is that
