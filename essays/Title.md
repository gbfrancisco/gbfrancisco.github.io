When attempting to understand new concepts that seem too complex to grasp or trying to master a certain skill but cannot seem to progress, it never hurts to ask for assistanceâ€”one beautiful aspect of the human language that has enabled humankind to prosper and improve our quality of life. **That is our ability to ask questions**. Each question has the potential to inspire new ideas and unlock breakthroughs that otherwise could not have been discovered; it could stimulate people's imagination and creativity, and it encourages others to learn about the subject matter. However, despite the benefits it offers, a question could also demotivate others, depending on its delivery and depth. For instance, a computer scientist will inevitably get stuck on certain problems, multiple times in his career. Sometimes, it is necessary to ask others some meaningful questions.
