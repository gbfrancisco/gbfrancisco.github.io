Sherlock Holmes never backed down from challenges; he thrived from them. No matter how difficult the case is, his unwavering passion and intense focus enables him to see things beyond the normal human eye. At a single glance, he could formulate countless deductions, and within few moments he could narrow them down to a single conclusion. One could aspire to acquire his boundless intelligence (and sarcasm).

But why Sherlock Holmes? What makes him so special that I am alluding to him in this article related to Computer Science? Surely, it is not because he is a high functioning sociopath. It is not his immense talent nor his incredible intelligence that inspires me to do work, it is his habits and actions when solving a case. In other words, in every case, he performs deep work.

From the author (and Computer Scientist) Cal Newport, deep work is the intense concentration when tackling on a given task. It is the type of focus that requires absolute attention to your work, avoiding all forms of distractions (including music, so sorry music fans...). Such complete involvement in your work allows you to create less mistakes, learn concepts faster and ironically reduce stress despite working intensely on a short burst of time.

I could see this as important for Computer Science students. The ability to completely avoid distractions can probably expedite one's learning, particularly in this demanding field. Working for a long period of time while watching T.V. or playing video games tends to be significantly less efficient than working on short, uninterrupted bursts. Perhaps this is why Dr. Newport says deep work is turning out to be more and more valuableâ€”in this expanding digital world, people are easily distracted from their everyday tasks. In Computer Science, I hope that I could also completely get rid of my distractions completely, but then again, it's another skill that I need to learn.
