## Imagine you just had a new born baby.

As you hold her in your arms, you cannot help but ponder what makes her so precious. You look at her beautiful, glittering eyes and realize that they not only provide you that feeling of warmth and comfort, but they also give you a sense of hope—a mysterious hope that this baby will turn the vapid to creative, the ordinary to something special. As parent, you will do everything in your power to nurture this baby and lead her to a bright and exciting future. You name this child, ***Semantic UI***.

## Raising Semantic is not as easy as you thought.

As Semantic grows up, you learn more about her characteristics; you categorize them as **Elements, Collections, Views, and Behaviors**. Within these categories are subcategories such as **container, image, grid, menu, etc.** which are also filled with even more subcategories like **types, groups. variations, etc.** Little did you know that Semantic possessed so many qualities—so many that it will definitely take some time and dedication to remember them all. Nevertheless, these said qualities could potentially erase your boredom and liven up your world because after all, who does not want live a life with a responsive *framework*. Therefore, you are motivated enough to understand more about each of Semantic's trait, as every parent should do.

## Managing a teenage Semantic is tough.

After some time, Semantic has become more responsive. You now have the confidence to order around a teenage girl to do your errands. You tell her to show you a **borderless menu**, and she gives you a white blank menu. You tell her to show you an **image item** on the menu and she will do exactly as you ask.

```html
<div class="ui borderless menu>
  <img class="ui image item" scr="https://www.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/usa/logo/m_logo.png">
                                                                                            </div>
```
