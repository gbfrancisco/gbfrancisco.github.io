# Cooking that Yummy Scrambled Eggs

Ever watched that video where Gordon Ramsay demonstrates how to cook the "perfect scrabled eggs"? Did you ever attempt to emulate his recipe only to end up in a kitchen disaster (or *nightmare*)? If you did, then welcome to the failure club, as I managed to taste defeat in my atrocious attempt on a dish that theoretically should be easy to recreate. However, after failing to follow the superstar chef's recipe, that did not deter me from learning how to cook scrambled eggs from other people. One thing I noticed, though, is that most of their scrambled egg recipes have a notable similarityâ€”they all use butter, salt, and pepper!

# Isn't it Obvious to Use Butter, Salt and Pepper?

Of course it is. However, that is not the realization that occurred to me. **You don't need to completely follow all their recipes to end up with a good scrambled egg!** You only needed to use butter, salt, and pepper to make it palatable; the rest is just extra details and flamboyance. Nevertheless, this notion of following the basic recipe, or *pattern* per se, reminds me how computer scientists, particularly software developers, utilize certain recipes to tackle problems related in their field. It allows them to organize their code and have some sort of gameplan or blueprint for work. These ***design patterns*** enable them to surgically idenitify bugs and errors while systematically forming new possible steps that get them closer to a solution for the problem.
