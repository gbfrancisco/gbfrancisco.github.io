## Coding Standards?

When your teacher assigns you an literary analysis essay to write, do you just go ahead and type whatever comes to your head in a huge pile of text? No, you follow the classic *introduction, body, conclusion* format. When you do your calculus homework, do you just write anywhere random equations and just circle (or box) your answer? Probably not (Hopefully not), you have to write your steps in orderly fashion so that the person checking your work would know that you did the problem correctly. Anyhow, following certain standards in some activities helps not only you, but also other people to evaluate your own work. In programming, I believe that coding standards enhances the readability of your code and it allows people to debug it faster.

## My Experience

When I first started programming, I never had a single clue about coding standards and check styles; I only focused on the content of my programs and ignorantly de-emphasizing the importance of proper formatting and checkstyles. As I gained more experience in programming, I slowly uncovered the significance of following coding standards. For instance, ICS 211 required everyone to install a checkstyle plugin on Eclipseâ€”if you forget to fix checkstyle errors on each homework, you get penalized. At first, it was tedious having to reformat everything, but as time went by, I gradually loved doing it. Just looking at my finished code with proper Javadoc, indentation, etc. made it more satisfying than ever. Now that I'm in Software Engineering (ICS 314), the rules haven't changed (it never will), and I'm back again with a new checkstyle called ESLint.
