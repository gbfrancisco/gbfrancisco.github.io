## Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC)

The Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (or HACC) is an event taking place every fall where the participants can showcase their creativity and technical abilities to develop applications to help solve various problems presented by the local community and state agencies. The participants must form teams and are given a couple or more weeks to design a product which they will have an opportunity to present should they get selected by the technical judges. HACC always had been an in-person event, but due to the COVID pandemic, it was held virtually via Zoom.

## And so it begins

The quick brown fox...

## A hand that helps

## Work, work, work

The quick brown fox...

## Aftermath
